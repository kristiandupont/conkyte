Generate random names for your next project based on various techniques.

Just go here: https://kristiandupont.github.io/conkyte/ and let it run until you see something you like.

There are currently three techniques. One tries to create new words out of syllable patterns (based on some of the research in [this paper](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/00437956.1978.11435661)). The second one takes existing words and replaces a letter in it (vowels with vowels, consonants with consonants) and the third simply concatenates two random words.

If you have further ideas or feedback, I'd love to hear it!
